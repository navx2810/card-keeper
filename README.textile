h1. Card :: Keeper

This application is used to keep track of your Magic: The Gathering inventory. This application offers:

* Search capabilities for any card in MTG.
* Storage options for keeping cards and counts that you own.
* Previews for the card, including images and metadata.

h2. How to use?

If you are building from source, you need to clone and install:

bc. > git clone http://github.com/navx2810/card-keeper.git
> cd card-keeper && npm i


Alternatively, if you have another package manager, like "yarn":https://yarnpkg.com, you could install it like so:


bc. > git clone http://github.com/navx2810/card-keeper.git
> cd card-keeper && yarn
